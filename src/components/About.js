                What do you get when you have a handful of excellent musicians, locked out of playing live gigs in early 2020? For members Brandon Kroeger, Mike Kroeger, Scottrocker, Robert Renman and Greg Kisser, the answer became obvious: start a virtual super-band dedicated to playing epic covers in homage to the songs that inspired each of them in their own warped way.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                What started out as a one-off project to cover one of our all-time favorite tunes, the 1992 alternative metal hit Midlife Crisis, by Faith No More, evolved very quickly. Even though the band members are located far apart (for instance there's a span of over 2,700 kilometers between Brandon and Mike), with the technology available and experience of the group, distance is no barrier. The musical chemistry of the group became immediately apparent. Within a few days of the fist mix of Midlife Crisis being completed, the name Warp Kings was adopted. The following day the bands logo was also created.

                Instruments are recorded at everyone's respective home studios and Greg created the logo. Robert Renman has mixed much of the music and Murray Yates, of Echoman Records, is has mixed the latest productions and can occasionally be found singing some extra harmonies on our tunes.

                With six singles now available on all major music streaming platforms, we hope you have as much fun listening to (and watching) our productions as weâ€™ve had making them!
